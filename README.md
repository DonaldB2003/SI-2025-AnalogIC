# 🛠️ SI-2025-AnalogIC-Design Internship
## 📝 Abstract
This repository documents my summer internship journey (June 2025) at Silicon University’s Advanced VLSI Lab, focusing on the design, simulation, and layout of Analog Integrated Circuits (ICs). The program emphasized hands-on learning with industry-standard tools, covering everything from device physics to post-layout verification. The highlight was the design and analysis of a two-stage CMOS operational amplifier, equipping me with practical skills for a career in VLSI and semiconductor technology.

## 📚 Introduction
Analog ICs are the backbone of real-world signal processing, powering applications from sensor interfaces to communications. This internship offered a structured exploration of analog design, blending theory with practical labs using Cadence Virtuoso, LTspice, and open-source EDA tools.

## 🏛️ Internship Details
Venue: Room 656, 5th Floor, New Admin Building, Silicon University 🏢
Duration: June 2nd – June 20th, 2025 📆
Timings: 10:00am–1:00pm, 2:30pm–5:30pm ⏰
Resource Persons: Dr. Saroj Rout, Prof. Prasant Swain, Mrinal Das 👨‍🏫

Tips for further enhancement:

Add more images (schematics, layouts, simulation results) from your own work as you progress.

Use more emojis for section headers:

📖 for theory, 🧪 for labs, 🖼️ for images, 📊 for results, 🧑‍💻 for instructions, 📚 for resources, 🙏 for acknowledgements.

Keep your README updated as you complete each lab.

This structure will make your GitHub page professional, visually appealing, and easy to navigate for peers and recruiters alike
